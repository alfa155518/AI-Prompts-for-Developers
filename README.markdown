## 1. Code Generation Prompts

### Basic Code Generation (Zero-Shot Prompting)
Prompt for generating well-structured code in a specific programming language.

**Prompt Template:**
```
You are an expert [programming language] developer. Write a function that [describe the task]. Ensure the function is:
- Well-documented: Add clear comments explaining each step.
- Optimized for performance: Use efficient data structures and algorithms where applicable.
- Robust: Handle edge cases such as empty inputs, incorrect data types, and large datasets.
- Modular: Keep the function reusable and avoid hardcoded values.
```

### Optimized Code Generation (Few-Shot Prompting)
Prompt for improving an existing code snippet using specific optimization techniques.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Here’s a basic implementation of [algorithm/function] in [programming language]:
[code snippet]
Now, improve this implementation by optimizing it using [optimization technique, e.g., memoization, dynamic programming, vectorization]. Explain:
- Why the optimized version is better in performance and efficiency.
- Time complexity improvements compared to the original.
- Any trade-offs.
```

### Code Translation (Cross-Language Prompting)
Prompt for converting code from one programming language to another.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Convert the following [source language] function into [target language]. Ensure that you:
- Maintain equivalent functionality in the new language.
- Explain key differences in syntax and behavior between the two languages.
- Highlight any necessary modifications due to differences in data types, function definitions, or execution models.
```

## 2. Debugging and Error Resolution

### Error Explanation and Fixes
Prompt for diagnosing and resolving code errors.

**Prompt Template:**
```
I’m seeing this error in my [programming language] code:
[error message]
Explain:
- Why is this error occurring?
- How to fix it - provide one or more solutions.
- Best practices to prevent similar errors in the future.
```

### Bug Identification
Prompt for identifying and fixing bugs in a function.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Here’s a function that isn’t returning the expected output:
[code snippet]
Describe:
- Why the function is failing and identify the root cause.
- How to fix it.
- Best practices to avoid similar bugs in the future.
```

### Performance Optimization
Prompt for optimizing a function’s performance or memory usage.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Analyze the following [programming language] function and suggest optimizations to improve its [performance/memory usage/time complexity]:
[code snippet]
Provide:
- An explanation of the current inefficiencies and why they impact performance.
- A step-by-step optimization strategy, including specific improvements.
- A revised version of the function with the applied optimizations.
- A comparison of time complexity before and after optimization.
```

## 3. Code Review and Best Practices

### Code Review for Best Practices
Prompt for reviewing code to improve readability, performance, and security.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Review the following [programming language] function and suggest improvements for readability, performance, and security:
[code snippet]
```

### Security Vulnerability Detection
Prompt for identifying and mitigating security risks in SQL queries.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Analyze the following SQL query and identify potential security risks:
[SQL query]
Provide a safer alternative and explain why it’s secure.
```

## 4. Documentation and Explanation

### Generating Docstrings
Prompt for creating detailed docstrings for a function.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Write a detailed docstring for the following [programming language] function:
[code snippet]
Make sure the docstring includes:
- A brief description of what the function does.
- Parameters with expected data types and descriptions.
- Return value with its type and meaning.
- Edge cases or exceptions the function may handle.
- Usage example (optional) to demonstrate correct usage.
```

## 5. AI for DevOps and Automation

### Dockerfile Generation
Prompt for generating a Dockerfile for a specific application.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Generate a Dockerfile to containerize a [technology/framework] application with the following requirements:
- Use a lightweight and optimized base image.
- Ensure all required dependencies are copied and installed efficiently.
- Expose the necessary ports for the application.
- Use an appropriate CMD or ENTRYPOINT to start the application.
- Keep the image size minimal and follow best practices for security and performance.
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
Prompt for creating a CI/CD pipeline configuration.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Write a [CI/CD tool] workflow to automate the deployment of a [technology/framework] application to [deployment platform] with the following requirements:
- Runs on specific events (e.g., code push to main).
- Installs necessary dependencies and prepares the application for deployment.
- Deploys the application to [target platform] efficiently.
- Ensures minimal permissions, caching, and optimized build processes.
- Provides logging and alerts for failures.
```

## 6. Data Processing and Analysis

### Data Cleaning with Pandas
Prompt for writing a Pandas script to clean and preprocess a dataset.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Write a Pandas script to clean and preprocess a dataset with the following steps:
- Remove duplicate rows efficiently.
- Fill missing values using an appropriate strategy (e.g., mean, median, or interpolation).
- Convert all column names to a consistent format (e.g., lowercase, snake_case).
- Save the processed DataFrame in a specified format (e.g., CSV, Parquet).
```

### SQL Query Optimization
Prompt for optimizing SQL queries for large datasets.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Optimize the following SQL query for faster execution on a large dataset:
[SQL query]
Provide:
- Inefficiencies in the current query.
- Optimized version of the query.
- Explanation of performance improvements.
- Best practices for writing efficient SQL queries on large datasets.
